This is the last RHIDE released: RHIDE v1.5 (Feb 17 2003 11:09:00)
Here I put the dependencies that I found on internet.
These dependencies aren't optimal, just enough to make the Linux dynamic
loader happy ;-)

This RHIDE can compile Turbo Vision on Debian bullseye (testing) while running
a Linux 5.7.10 64 bits kernel. This is the current Debian testing distro
17 years later.
Of course it fails to connect to the X server, but it works acceptably on
a gnome-terminal.

I used this binary to update the library dependencies.
