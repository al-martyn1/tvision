# Turbo Vision

A multiplatform Text User Interface from the '90s

This is a port of the Borland Turbo Vision framework to various platforms, including:

- Linux
- Windows
- DOS
- QNX
- Various UNIX flavors (BSD, AIX, Solaris, Darwin, etc.)

This port was started by Robert HÃ¶hne around 1996 and I (Salvador E. Tropea) started to maintain it in 1998.
So don't get surprised about code with old style.

The original project is hosted by Source Forge: [TVision](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tvision/)

I moved this repo to GitHub because a lot of forks are floating around in GitHub and is much more easy to compare and incorporated portions of them if the project is also hosted at GitHub.

All the interesting code is in the `tvision` folder.
Yes I know this is uncommon, but this is how it was arranged back in 1998 using CVS.
